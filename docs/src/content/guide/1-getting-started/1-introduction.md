## What is Astrolingo?

Astrolingo is a free and open-source project to create beautiful, accessible language learning websites. It combines a *software* part (a static site generator and utilities) and an *educational* part (a collection of language learning websites).

It began as a personal project to help me learn Finnish. I wanted a website tailored to my learning needs — and since I had the skills and time, I decided to make it open-source and share it with the world.

If you're passionate about learning a language, and helping others in the process, Astrolingo is for you. You can use the software, the designs, and the content freely — for personal or commercial projects. Contributions of all kinds are warmly welcomed ❤️

> This « Guide » section focuses on the educational part. If you're looking for the software part, please check the [Documentation](/docs/).
